# StardewWrapMultiplayer

Update of Shalankwa's mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2180) with compatibility with 1.5 and last smapi api.

Allow you to teleport to another player with pressing key "j" by default.

Controller usage : press right stick (by default) to open the menu, it will also open the chat so press return button to close the chat and use the wrap menu, press return again to close it. 

To change the key, you can edit the file "config.json" in the mod folder, entry "KeyBinding" (format "key" : 1 or 0, 1 is required if the current button also provide another action like  when the right stick is holds, otherwise 0). 

Possible values provided by SMAPI are listed here : https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings section "Available bindings"
